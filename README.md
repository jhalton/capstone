# Quoth the Raven

Quoth the Raven is an e-commerce app inspired by Barnes and Noble and other book sellers.

It allows an admin user to:

- Create books and collections and manage them both through an admin portal and directly from the book detail and collections pages

It allows any user to:

- Browse through collections and from the book detail, and if logged in, that user can also add that book to a wishlist
- Create and manage their wishlists, and while viewing books in their wishlist, view the title, author, and description of the book.
- Search for any book by name in the navigation's search bar
